JavaScript Project | Create Product Search Engine/Bar/Filter in JavaScript

This code defines a function called "search" which is triggered when the user performs a search on a webpage. The function starts by retrieving the value of the search input field and converting it to uppercase. It then retrieves the element that contains the list of items to be searched and loops through each item in the list.

For each item, the function retrieves the first h2 element that is a child of the current item and checks if the search term appears in the text content of the h2 element. If the search term is found, the current item is displayed. If not, the current item is hidden.

Overall, this function is designed to enable searching and filtering of a list of items on a webpage based on user input. The code uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to achieve this functionality.
